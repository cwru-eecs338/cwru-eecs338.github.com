When you register for moss, what happens is they just send you a Perl script for uploading submissions. 
I have attached the moss script given to me by Gary Doran. 

Before using the script:
- Be sure to download all assignments and make a directory of only the zip file you have downloaded. (To download all assignments as a zip- http://library.blackboard.com/ref/3ea64795-6ecc-4abd-b595-0a9a8dfdec94/Content/_instructor_course/instructor_course_tool_assess_assignments_download.htm) 
- Extract that zip (Usually named gradebook_date) into the directory. 
- And run 'extract.py' also added into this git directory.
- Be sure that every student has a directory and their files in it. If they have sub-directories, be sure to either fix them in grading or include them when running the code. 

Using the script:

- We will need parameters to run the script that are;

-l specifies the language (probably c or java)
-d says to group the assignment files by directory
In the case of a "base file" that is distributed to the students (i.e. an interface or some starter code).To exclude such files in the plagiarism check, use the "-b" flag.

Examples of running the script:

$ ./moss.pl -l c -d as1/*/*.c as1/*/*.h (Will get every file of extention .c and .h in the directories created)

$ ./moss.pl -l c -b base_file.c -d as1/*/*.c as1/*/*.h (With a base file if any)

After using the script:

The script should give you an URL to check the cheating results. It stays only a few days so you can use 'wget -mk URL' to download them.

-Remarks-

I thank Gary Doran for the information he gave me in Spring 2014-15 to use this software.

<h3><a name="connecting">Connecting to a Unix Lab Computer</a></h3>

<p>
	After your Unix lab account is created, you can use an ssh client
	to connect. SSH stands for <i>Secure SHell</i>, and opens an encrypted
	connection to a shell interface on a remote computer. From Mac OS X or Linux, you can
	connect using the command:

<blockquote><code>ssh abc123@eecslinab.case.edu</code></blockquote>

If you are using Windows, you will need to download the
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY</a>
ssh client (or something similar). With PuTTY, you specify the host name (eecslinab.case.edu) in
the
appropriate field, and you will be prompted for a user name when you login.
</p>
<p>
	If you are prompted to accept certificates and trust that you are connecting
	to the correct machine, then say &#8220;yes.&#8221; The password should be your CWRU Single
	Sign-On
	password. </p>

<h3><a name="files"></a>Accessing Files on a Unix Lab Computer</h3>

<p>
	If you use Windows, there is a program called
	<a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a> that will let you copy
	files between the lab computer and your machine. The login process
	is similar to that for PuTTY. </p>

<p>
	For Mac OS X and Linux/Unix users, you can use the command <code>scp</code>,
	which stands for <i>secure copy</i>. For example, to copy files in [dir] from
	your computer to the lab computer, you can use this command on your computer:

<blockquote><code>scp -r [dir] abc123@eecslinab.case.edu:</code></blockquote>

Here, the <code>-r</code> indicates that the copy should be performed
recursively on the entire directory. If you just want to copy a single file
[file], all you need is:

<blockquote><code>scp [file] abc123@eecslinab.case.edu:</code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
	By default, <code>abc123@eecslinab.case.edu:</code> specifies the home directory
	of the remote (lab) machine. If you want to copy into a subdirectory of your
	home directory, you can specify that information after the colon, such as:

<blockquote><code>scp [file] abc123@eecslinab.case.edu:EECS338/HW1/</code></blockquote>

</p>
<p>
	Copying files from the remote (lab) computer just works with the arguments
	reversed. So again, from your computer, issue the command:

<blockquote><code>scp -r abc123@eecslinab.case.edu:EECS338/HW1 [dir]</code></blockquote>

The copied files will be placed in [dir]. See the <code>man</code> page for more
details.
</p>
<p>
	There is probably also a GUI&#8211;based solution to connecting to the lab
	servers for Mac OS X and Linux, but I'm not familiar with the details for Mac or
	specific Linux distributions. But as an example, on Ubuntu it's under
	<i>Places</i>, <i>Connect to Server</i>, using SSH as server type. </p>

<h3><a name="config">Configuration</a></h3>

<p>
	On GitHub, there are some <a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/dotfiles">configuration
	files</a>
	that will make it nicer to interact with the shell, screen, and Vim, described
	below.

<h3><a name="screen">GNU Screen</a></h3>

<p>
	Screen is a powerful tool that lets you create multi-tabbed, detachable
	shell session on a remote computer. To use it, type the command:
<blockquote><code>screen</code></blockquote>
Now, you are in something like a shell session within a shell session (have you seen
<i>Inception</i>?). You can be doing some work here (for example, editing some
code). But what if you want to do something else, like test your program that
runs for a while? You can use <code>ctrl+a c</code> to create a
new screen. It will look like your old screen disappeared, but it is still there
in the background.
</p>
<p>
	Now, in your new screen, you can start your program, and let it run. To switch
	back to your original screen, use <code>ctrl+a 0</code>. Now, you can do some
	more work, and switch back to your running program using <code>ctrl+a 1</code>.
	In general, <code>ctrl+a #</code> switches to screen number #. </p>

<p>
	You've been working in the lab, but it's time to go home. However, your program
	in Screen #1 is still running. No problem. Just use <code>ctrl+a d</code> to
	detach from the screen session, and you will be dropped back to your original
	shell session. However, the screen session is still in existence, with your
	program still running in it. </p>

<p>
	When you get home, you log back into the lab computer via <code>ssh</code>.
	Then, you type:
<blockquote><code>screen -ls</code></blockquote>
to see a list of existing shell sessions. There's only one (the one you left
running at the lab), so you type:
<blockquote><code>screen -r</code></blockquote>
to reattach to the session. If there were multiple sessions, you could use:
<blockquote><code>screen -r [session id]</code></blockquote>
And, now you can resume the work you started in the lab.
</p>
<p>
	As a final note, screen is also useful in case your ssh connection is dropped
	for whatever reason. You can log back in and reattach without losing any work. </p>

<h3><a name="editor">Using a Text Editor</a></h3>

<p>
	While connected to a remote computer via ssh, you will need to edit text files
	from the command line. Simple editors like nano exist, but I strongly recommend
	getting used to either Vim or Emacs, which are both powerful editors. I
	personally use Vim (I'm writing this page in Vim right now), and here's just
	some of the stuff it can do out of the box: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Code auto&#8211;completion</li>
	<li>Spell checking</li>
	<li>Block, line, and traditional visual selection</li>
	<li>Multiple windows</li>
	<li>Automatic text wrapping and indentation</li>
	<li>Execute shell commands</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Vim (or Emacs) is powerful because anything you would ever want to do can be
	done without your fingers leaving the keyboard. It might take some extra time to
	learn, but there are some good tutorials online and it is worth it. In fact,
	typing the command:
<blockquote><code>vimtutor</code></blockquote>
from the shell is a good place to start.
</p>
<h3><a name="pipes">Pipe Camp</a></h3>

<p>
	In the OS course, you will learn about various methods of interprocess
	communication. In the shell, pipes are a way to hook processes together. </p>

<p>
	Every process has access to &#8220;standard in&#8221; (stdin) and
	&#8220;standard out&#8221; (stdout), which are treated like files. By default,
	the contents of these files are read from and written to the shell. However,
	pipes allow redirection of stdin and stdout to files, or other processes. </p>

<p>
	For example, consider the command:
<blockquote><code>ps ax</code></blockquote>
which prints a list of processes to stdout. However, this list might be long, so
that the processes at the top of the list disappear. There is a command called
<code>more</code>, which accepts input from stdin, and prints only a bit at a
time (as much as will fit on the screen) to stdout. If we pipe the result of
<code>ps</code> into <code>more</code> like so:
<blockquote><code>ps ax | more</code></blockquote>
then we can scroll through the output at our leisure.
</p>
<p>
	As a final example, suppose we are running a processes called
	<code>myserver</code> and we want to kill it. In order to use the
	<code>kill</code> command, we need to know the process id. We can manually
	search for it in the output of <code>ps</code>, or we can use <code>grep</code>,
	which can find regular expressions in stdin. So we use the command chain:
<blockquote><code>ps ax | grep -w myserver</code></blockquote>
which will find and print all lines in the output of <code>ps</code> that
contain the word &#8220;myserver&#8221; (the <code>-w</code> argument specifies
a whole word match).
</p>
<p>
	The output might be something like:
<blockquote><code>
	21588 pts/0 S+ 0:02 myserver <br/>
	24344 pts/0 S+ 0:00 grep -w vim
</code></blockquote>
in which case we could then kill the server using:
<blockquote><code>kill 21588</code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
	Finally, if we want to save the results of a command for later, we can pipe
	stdout to file using <code>&gt;</code>, or <code>&gt;&gt;</code> to append to an
	existing file. For example, we can save the process list via:
<blockquote><code>ps ax &gt; processes.txt</code></blockquote>
Likewise, we can use a file in place of stdin like so:
<blockquote><code>grep -w vim &lt; processes.txt</code></blockquote>

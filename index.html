<h3>03/29/11: Java Threading</h3>
<p>
Java version of the Readers-Writers simulation is posted 
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/JavaThreader" >here</a>.
</p>
<h3>03/28/11: POSIX</h3>
<p>
Example using POSIX Semaphores and POSIX Threads Posted
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/PosixExample">here</a>.
</p>
-->
<h3>02/21/11: System V Shared Memory and Monitors in Java</h3>
<p>
First, we'll review semaphores and introduce the API for shared memory in
System V Unix, using the same example code for the
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/semaphores">bounded buffer problem</a>.
Then, we'll look at how monitors are implemented in Java, with example code for the 
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/java_monitors">dining philosophers problem</a>.
</p>
<h3>02/14/12: System V Semaphores</h3>
<p>
Introduce API for semaphores in System V Unix, with example code for the
 <a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/semaphores">bounded buffer problem</a>.
</p>
<h3>02/07/12: Pipes</h3>
<p>
Today, we'll talk about named and unnamed pipes in Unix. First, I'll show how
pipes can be used to implement communication between processes, with
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/mario_pipe">this code example</a>.
Next, I'll talk about using pipes in the shell, with a brief introduction to
shell scripts. Then, I'll show how shell pipes can be implemented in C using
unnamed pipes and the <code>dup()</code> call, with
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/pipes">this example</a>. Finally, I'll
show how to create and use named pipes from the shell.
</p>
<p>
With any remaining time, I'll discuss
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/structs_getpwuid">structured types in C</a>,
which will be used in future assignments.
</p>
<h3>01/31/12: System Calls</h3>
<p>
The second recitation will focus on system calls. First, we will discuss how they
are implemented in the kernel, with
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/hello_syscalls">an example</a> of
writing to standard out as a system call. Then, I will review an example of
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/fork_and_exec"><code>fork()</code> and
<code>exec()</code></a>,
which will be required for your first assignment.
</p>
<p>
Other code examples from previous years describe
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/syscall_examples">environment variable</a>
system calls, and
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/organization_example">how you can organize</a>
a C program that consists of several files.
</p>
<p>
Some slides are available <a href="slides/C_and_System_Calls.pdf">here</a>, or
more generally, from the <a href="slides.html">slides page</a>.
</p>

<h3>01/24/12: First Recitation</h3>
<p>An <a href="intro.html">introduction to Linux</a>, which will be used for the
programming assignments. I reviewed <a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/hello338">a very simple C program</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/c_basics">a description of some of the basics of C</a> for those of you used
to Java.</p>

                            <h3>Summary</h3>
                            <p>
This site will be updated with materials for the course during the semester.
Currently, any code will be hosted at <a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338">GitHub</a>
for easy access.

						<h3>2013-04-16: Recitation 12</h3>

						<p>
							The twelfth recitation focused on <a
								href="slides/shell-programming.pdf">shell scripting in bash</a>
							and some of the programming constructs that are provided by the
							shell. We examined a <a href="https://github.com/mruffalo/btrfs-snapshot-boot">
							shell script addition to the Ubuntu (12.10+) initramfs scripts
							</a>that creates btrfs snapshots of every top-level subvolume when
							a system is booted.
						</p>

						<p>
							Additionally, we reviewed some material for the midterm exam on
							Wednesday, 2013-04-17.
						</p>

						<h3>2013-04-09: Recitation 11</h3>

						<p>
							In the eleventh recitation we discussed the usage of <a
								href="slides/sockets.pdf">the Berkeley sockets API</a>, using
							<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/sockets">example code by
								Stuart Morgan</a>.
						</p>

						<h3>2013-04-02: Recitation 10</h3>

						<p>
							In the tenth recitation we discussed the usage of <a
								href="slides/remote-procedure-calls.pdf">Unix remote procedure
							calls</a>, including
							a primer on the RPC language and how to structure a program using
							code generated by rpcgen. We examined the
							<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/RPC-Integer-Echo">RPC
								integer echo</a> program, including the code produced
							by rpcgen.
						</p>

						<p>
							Note that three new Linux servers are available for this assignment:
							eecslinab2, eecslinab3 and eecslinab7.
							<span style="font-weight: bold;">Data stored on eecslinab2, 3, and 7 will not be retained; these servers will be wiped and shut down over summer break.</span>
						</p>

						<h3>2013-03-26: Recitation 9</h3>

						<p>
							In the ninth recitation we revisited the <a
								href="slides/posix-ipc.pdf">POSIX IPC API</a> and its usage for
							threading, semaphores and shared memory. We reexamined the <a
								href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/PosixExample">example
							POSIX threads code</a> and its usage of the pthreads functions. We
							also discussed the <a
								href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/python_semaphores">Python
							version of the &quot;semaphores&quot; example code</a>, which uses
							the <a href="http://semanchuk.com/philip/sysv_ipc/">sysv_ipc</a>
							module mentioned below. We examined the <a
								href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/python_threads">python_threads</a>
							example code, which uses Python's threading module. We discussed <a
								href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">important
							caveats in using Python threads</a> and also examined a <a
								href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/java_monitors">Java
							implementation of the dining philosophers algorithm</a>. </p>

						<h3>2013-03-19: Recitation 8</h3>

						<p>
							In the eigth recitation we revisited the System V <a
								href="slides/shared-memory.pdf">shared memory API</a> and its
							usage. We examined the <a
								href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/semaphores">example
							semaphore code</a>, focusing on the usage of the shared memory calls
							to pass structured data between processes (specifically, casting the
							pointer returned by shmat() to whatever data type you want to use).
							We also briefly discussed System V shared memory and semaphore usage
							in Python through the <a
								href="http://semanchuk.com/philip/sysv_ipc/">sysv_ipc</a>
							package. </p>

						<h3>2013-03-05: Recitation 7</h3>

						<p>
							In the seventh recitation we discussed the concept of threads, and
							we looked at an overview of the <a
								href="https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=d37b66n_4d93jp2g5">POSIX
							threads and POSIX semaphore APIs</a> as well as a brief <a
								href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/PosixExample">code example
							showing the use of these POSIX APIs</a>. Note that the error
							checking in the POSIX code example is not sufficient because it does
							not check for the conditions defined on the man page -- copy and
							paste at your own risk! We revisited the System V semaphore API and
							saw <a
								href="https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=d37b66n_5c85qskgc">how
							to write wrappers for the semaphore wait() and signal()
							operations</a> to abstract away the complexity of the System V API.
						</p>

						<h3>2013-02-26: Recitation 6</h3>

						<p>
							We examined the Java implementation of monitors and a <a
								href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/java_monitors">Java
							solution to the dining philosophers problem</a>. Then we spent some
							time reviewing material for the midterm, including example problems
							and how to structure an answer to a concurrent algorithm analysis
							problem.

						<p>

						<h3>2013-02-17: Recitation 5</h3>

						<p>
							We discussed the System V APIs for semaphores and shared memory.
							Slides for semaphores are <a
								href="http://cwru-eecs338.github.com/slides/05Semaphores.sxi.pdf">here</a>.
							Slides for shared memory are <a
								href="http://cwru-eecs338.github.com/slides/06SharedMem.sxi.pdf">here</a>.
							We saw these APIs in action with a solution to the producer-consumer
							problem. Two resources for further learning:
						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/semaphores/">The Little
								Book of Semaphores</a> (warning: the syntax in this book may not
								conform 100% to the structures presented in class)
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interprocess-Communications-Linux-Nooks-Crannies/dp/0130460427">Interprocess
									Communications in Linux</a></li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<h3>2013-02-12: Recitiation 4</h3>

						<p>
							MMR reviewed approaches to assignment 2. </p>

						<h3>2013-02-05: Recitation 3</h3>

						<p>
							In the third recitation we discussed three debugging tools: strace,
							valgrind, and gdb. To get the most out of valgrind and gdb, add
							debugging information to your binaries by compiling with gcc using
							the -g flag. We discussed the concept of pipes and reviewed a <a
								href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/mario_pipe">a simple pipe
							example</a> using pipes for interprocess communication, and <a
								href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/pipes">an example of
							duplicating pipe file descriptors</a> to redirect stdin and stdout.
							You will need to understand all these concepts to complete
							Assignment 2. </p>

						<h3>2013-01-29: Recitation 2</h3>

						<p>
							Recitation 2 was an introduction to C highlighting the differences
							from Java. We touched on the compiler (gcc), GNU Make and Makefiles,
							organization of C code. We also discussed two examples: first, <a
								href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/hello_syscalls">system
							calls from the assembler up</a>; second, <a
								href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/fork_and_exec">how to use
							fork() and exec()<a/>.
						</p>


						<h3>2013-01-22: Recitation 1</h3>

						<p>
							The first recitiation was an <a href="intro.html">introduction to
							Linux</a>, which will be used for the programming assignments. We
							discussed the manual (man) system, and how to use to the manual to
							find information on system calls. </p>

						<h3>Summary</h3>

						<p>
							This site will be updated with materials for the course during the
							semester.
							Currently, any code will be hosted at <a
								href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338">GitHub</a>
							for easy access. </p>

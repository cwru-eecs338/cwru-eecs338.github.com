<h3>01/25/11: C, System Calls, and You</h3>
<p>
The second recitation covers some
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/c_basics">basics about the C
programming</a> language that you might not have learned (or have forgotten
since you took <i>Compilers</i>). This semester, you can use Java for your
assignments, but C is recommended.
</p>
<p>
In addition to C basics, various system calls are reviewed, with examples of
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/organization_example">fork</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/syscall_examples">environment variable calls</a>.
</p>
<p>
The recitation slides are available
<a href="slides/C_and_System_Calls.pdf">here</a>, or from the
<a href="slides.html">slides page</a>.
<h3>01/17/11: First Recitation</h3>
<p>An <a href="intro.html">introduction to Linux</a>, which will be used for the programming assignments.</p>

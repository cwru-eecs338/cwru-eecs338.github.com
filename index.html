<h3>02/22/11: Monitors in Java</h3>
<p>
Look at how monitors are implemented in Java, with example code for the 
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/java_monitors">dining philosophers problem</a>.
</p>
<h3>02/15/11: System V Shared Memory</h3>
<p>
Introduce API for shared memory in System V Unix, using the same example code for the 
 <a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/semaphores">bounded buffer problem</a>.
</p>
<h3>02/08/11: System V Semaphores</h3>
<p>
Introduce API for semaphores in System V Unix, with delicious example code for the
 <a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/semaphores">bounded buffer problem</a>.
</p>
<h3>02/01/11: Structs and Pipes</h3>
<p>
Examples of using <a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/structs_getpwuid">structured types in C</a>, followed by an
introduction to <a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/mario_pipe">unnamed pipes</a>.
</p>
<h3>01/25/11: C, System Calls, and You</h3>
<p>
The second recitation covers some
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/c_basics">basics about the C
programming</a> language that you might not have learned (or have forgotten
since you took <i>Compilers</i>). This semester, you can use Java for your
assignments, but C is recommended.
</p>
<p>
In addition to C basics, various system calls are reviewed, with examples of
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/organization_example">fork</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/cwru-eecs338/syscall_examples">environment variable calls</a>.
</p>
<p>
The recitation slides are available
<a href="slides/C_and_System_Calls.pdf">here</a>, or from the
<a href="slides.html">slides page</a>.
<h3>01/17/11: First Recitation</h3>
<p>An <a href="intro.html">introduction to Linux</a>, which will be used for the programming assignments.</p>
                            <h3>Summary</h3>
                            <p>
